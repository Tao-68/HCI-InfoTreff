# Project Documentation

## Vision Statement:
Employees, students or professors who want convenient access to refreshments and information about events need a quick overview of the daily Infotreff-Café menu. They want a single source of information.
"InfoTreff Connect" is a mobile app for drinks menus and events that provides a quick and easy view of the InfoTreff's menu and events. In contrast to the current non-digital card, our app provides an interactive and more centralised platform for the daily café offer and makes it more accessible.

## Motivation 

Students get the chance to see the complete offerings and find more easily what they like to drink, easy possibility to include special cards at events. At the same time, the app can also be used as an overview area for events.

## MVP

The minimum requirements for this App are that the menue and event items are displayed on the related screen. The basic screen for menu and events shows only basic information like price and diet. If an item gets clicked on screen all additional information are shown. 

## possible Delighter

Events offer the option to be exported as calender item. In addition to that the events provide a feature to share them with others. 
As a second delighter the app contains the option to give direct feedback to the InfoTreff crew.
Features for likes and popularity of items can be switched of in the settings.
