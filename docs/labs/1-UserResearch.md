# User Research
We have opted for user interviews as user research.

## Hypotheses
Users want all information in one app and not from different sources

Users want pictures of the drinks

Users want descriptions (ingredients, allergies, vegan) of the drinks and snacks

Users want to be informed about events

Users want to save the events directly in the calendar

Users would like to have the opportunity to give feedback 

## Questions for user interviews

1. how often do you visit the Infotreff-Café and what do you usually order?
2. which offers do you know in the Infotreff Café?
3. how do you find out about the offers in the restaurants or cafés?
4. what is your experience with the current presentation of the offer?
5. what information about the ingredients would be important to you?
6. how would detailed descriptions and pictures of the drinks and snacks influence your purchase decision?
7. what do you think of an overview for events?
8. would you like to be able to integrate events into your calendar? 
9. would you like to be able to share events with others? 
10. would you use such an application as an app or via the web?
11. would social features, such as seeing which items are popular with students, influence your choice?

## Results of the interviews

1. Average visit is 3 times per week, only one interviewee has never been to the Info-Treff-Café
2. Most interviewees know the offers pretty well regarding the menu, only some mentioned the events --> focus on events (?)
3. Most inform themselves through on-site resources or through online menu. 
   Only some inform themselves through emails and posters (regarding events) or directly through the café.
4. Most users are satisfied with the current presentation as they find the layout clear presented (can use it for orientation)
5. Currently most interviewees are interested in the allergens (such as lactose contents, vegan, vegetarian) and the ingredients. Some may be on a specific diet which may influence how they choose their meal. One specified wanting to know about the availability or scarcity of items on the menu
6. Most are unaffected by the pictures while making decisions. The feature will be used if it is available
7. Has a very positive feedback from interviewees, stating the feature is great
8. Has a very positive feedback from interviewees, stating the feature is great
9. Has a very positive feedback from interviewees, stating the feature is great
10. Mixed feedback from interviewees, some find it easier with an app, while others find the web app cooler. But the app on the phone has more vote compared to the web
11.  Most interviewees will be influenced especially while trying new things out. One mentioned that it would be great if able to see how many people are attending an event and a feature to state that they are attending the event (enable button for function)

## Project model: 

We have decided in favour of Agile UX as a process model. We think it fits best with the approach we have planned for this semester, based on the lab exercises. In our opinion, Double Diamond is too powerful and large in its functions to be used effectively on our small scale. We also liked the Design Sprint approach, but we found the effort on the project and process management side too high.
