# User Research
We have opted for user interviews as user research.

## Hypotheses
Users want all information in one app and not from different sources

Users want pictures of the drinks

Users want descriptions (ingredients, allergies, vegan) of the drinks and snacks

Users want to be informed about events

Users want to save the events directly in the calendar

Users would like to have the opportunity to give feedback 

## Questions for user interviews

1. how often do you visit the Infotreff-Café and what do you usually order?
2. which offers do you know in the Infotreff Café?
3. how do you find out about the offers in the restaurants or cafés?
4. what is your experience with the current presentation of the offer?
5. what information about the ingredients would be important to you?
6. how would detailed descriptions and pictures of the drinks and snacks influence your purchase decision?
7. what do you think of an overview for events?
8. would you like to be able to integrate events into your calendar? 
9. would you like to be able to share events with others? 
10. would you use such an application as an app or via the web?
11. would social features, such as seeing which items are popular with students, influence your choice?

## Project model: 

We have decided in favour of Agile UX as a process model. We think it fits best with the approach we have planned for this semester, based on the lab exercises. In our opinion, Double Diamond is too powerful and large in its functions to be used effectively on our small scale. We also liked the Design Sprint approach, but we found the effort on the project and process management side too high.
