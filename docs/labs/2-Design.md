# Design

At the start of our design process we created two Paper Prototypes independetly from each other.  
  
## Prototype 1:  

![Prototype_Thomas_1](../PaperPrototypes/design_thomas1.jpg){: height="5em" width="5em"}  
![Prototype_Thomas_2](../PaperPrototypes/design_thomas2.jpg){: height="5em" width="5em"}  
![Prototype_Thomas_3](../PaperPrototypes/design_thomas3.jpg){: height="5em" width="5em"}  
![Prototype_Thomas_4](../PaperPrototypes/design_thomas4.jpg){: height="5em" width="5em"}  
![Prototype_Thomas_5](../PaperPrototypes/design_thomas5.jpg){: height="5em" width="5em"}    
![Prototype_Thomas_6](../PaperPrototypes/design_thomas6.jpg){: height="5em" width="5em"}  
  
## Prototype 2:  

![Prototype_Emil_1](../PaperPrototypes/design_emil1.jpg){: height="5em" width="5em"}  
![Prototype_Emil_2](../PaperPrototypes/design_emil2.jpg){: height="5em" width="5em"}  
  
Then we combined the features we liked into one final Paper Prototype.  
During the whole process we made sure to test our prototypes with potential users and integrate the feedback into our design.  
  
## Final Paper Prototype:  

![Prototype_Final_1](../PaperPrototypes/FinalPaperPrototype1.jpg){: height="5em" width="5em"}  
![Prototype_Final_2](../PaperPrototypes/FinalPaperPrototype2.jpg){: height="5em" width="5em"}  
![Prototype_Final_3](../PaperPrototypes/FinalPaperPrototype3.jpg){: height="5em" width="5em"}  

## Logo & Colours
We decided to use the already excisting logo of the InfoTreff Cafe and derived the colours for the app from
it with only some slight adjustments for better readability.

![Logo_InfoTreff](../PaperPrototypes/logoInfoTreff.png){: height="5em" width="5em"}  
![Colours_InfoTreff](../PaperPrototypes/Farben_Infotreff_app.png){: height="5em" width="5em"}  

##Font  
The Font used in the final prototype is Averia Serif Libre, which is available under an Open Font Licens.  
The Font has minor serifs and rounded edges and therefore pair well with the cafes logo.  

The Font will mainly be used with regular weight and in four sizes:  
- Headline 1: 30/bold
- Headline 2: 25/regular
- Text: 20/regular
- Menu Item: 16/regular
