# Design

At the start of our design process we created to Paper Prototypes independetly from each other.  
  
Prototype 1:  
![Prototype_Thomas_1](../paperPrototypes/design_thomas1.jpg)  
![Prototype_Thomas_2](../paperPrototypes/design_thomas2.jpg)  
![Prototype_Thomas_3](../paperPrototypes/design_thomas3.jpg)  
![Prototype_Thomas_4](../paperPrototypes/design_thomas4.jpg)  
![Prototype_Thomas_5](../paperPrototypes/design_thomas5.jpg)  
![Prototype_Thomas_6](../paperPrototypes/design_thomas6.jpg)  
  
Prototype 2:  
![Prototype_Emil_1](../paperPrototypes/design_emil1.jpg)  
![Prototype_Emil_2](../paperPrototypes/design_emil2.jpg)  
  
Then we combined the features we liked into one final Paper Prototype.  
  
Final Paper Prototype:

![Prototype_Final_3](../paperPrototypes/FinalPaperPrototype3.jpg)  

We decided to use the already excisting logo of the InfoTreff Cafe and derived the colours for the app from
it with only some slight adjustments for better readability.
